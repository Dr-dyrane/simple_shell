## Introduction

Simple Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter that reads commands from either standard inpur or from a file, and execute them.

This program was written as part of a coding challenge on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for ALX SE cohort 12 group project: simple\_shell, and may not be suitable for use in production enviroments.

## Getting Started

## Installation

To build the program, simple run the following commands:

This will build the `shell` executable.

To get started , clone the repository and compile the program using `gcc` compiler:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/simple_shell.git
$ cd simple_shell
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantric *.c -o shell
```

## Description

This program implements a basic shell in C language. It provides a simple command-line interface for the user to execute commands. The program reads input from the user and executes the command using the `execve` system call.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the `shell` executable. The program will display a prompt and wait for user input. Enter a command and press enter to execute the command.

```bash
$ ./shell
```

You will be presneted with a prompt that looks like this:

```bash
(sh)$
```
You can then enter commands to execute, either one at a time, or multiple commands on the same line seperated by a semicolon;

```bash
(sh)$ ls
file.txt file2.txt file3.txt
(sh)$ pwd; ls
/home/user/simple_shell
file.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

To exit the program, simply type the `exit` command:

```bash
(sh)$ exit
```

## Commands

The Simple Shell supports a variety of commands, including built-in commands and external commands:

```bash
$ <command> [arguments]
```

## Examples

```bash
$ ls
$ cd /home/user/directory
$ echo "Hello, world!"
```

## Built-in Commands

The Simple Shell also includes some built-in commands:

```txt
cd - Change the current working directory.
exit - Exit the shell.
```

## Examples

```bash
$ cd /home/user/directory
$ exit
```

## Exit Status

The Simple Shell returns an exit status to indicate whether the command was executed successfully or not. If the command was executed successfully, the exit status will be 0. If the command was not executed successfully, the exit status will be a non-zero integer.
